                           I'm Sophie Tobisch from Germany. IÂ´m interested in web development since 8th grade -
                            when my informatics teacher showed us how to make our first hello world web-page in plain html. 
                            After that I continued to follow my interest by having a side job in a small agency, self study 
                            and finally the study of Online Media at the HFU, where I'll be writing my bachelor thesis in the next semester. <br>
                            Apart from coding I love diving and photography.

                           <p>I want to participate in the summer school because I like to learn new things that interest me. 
                              I have heard of most of the things mentioned on the landing page but never actually used them in 
                              a real project - it's time to change that and to become more fluent in these techniques. And it's always easier 
                              to learn in a group and with the help of experts - who can gently push you in the right direction - than to learn 
                              all alone<br>
                              Another point is that I like to become more confident in my own abilities. I know I am not totally stupid 
                              and I have some abilities but when it comes to 'selling' them or showing them I suddenly feel like I'm not 
                              good enough for this job because there might occur a problem I haven't thought of yet and therefore can't solve.  <br>
                              I also like to meet people who have the same passion as me to build helpful relationships for the future.  <br>
                              The last reason is my bachelor thesis (which includdes coding). I am writing about AWS and headless CMS and 
                              I feel like I could learn a lot about these things during summer school.

                           My biggest challenge was probably this page. I'm currently on holiday in a hotel and the WiFi is so slow, I can't really google anything. 
                           I wasn't aware how much I used it for all the little problems and how horrible it really is if you cannot use it at all. <br>
                           I also like to try out new things - for e.g. this page is my first attempt at using the skeleton framework (not clever if 
                           you can't google all its features).<br>
                           This habit often leads to little fragments that are done totally differently from the rest of my project - also not that good.
